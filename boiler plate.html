<h3>Moby-Dick: A classic tale of the sea</h3>
<a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="_blank"><img src="moby_dick.png" alt="W3Schools.com"></a>
<p><i><a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick">Moby-Dick</a></i> by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:</p>
<div class="indent"> <p>Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.</p></div>
<p>Ater driving off his spleen (which can't be good for you),Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one jillion pages. The only thing bigger thn Moby Dick (who--<i>spoiler alert!--</i> is a giant whale) is the book itself.</p>
